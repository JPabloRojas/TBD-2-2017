## Typical usage

### Simple
Use this option when you need to receive all the resize events.

```javascript
<div v-resize="onResize">
```

### Throttle
Use throttle when you need to rate-limit resize events frequency.


* With default timeout (150 ms):
```javascript
<div v-resize.throttle="onResize">
```

* With custom timeout (in ms):
```javascript
<div v-resize.throttle.100="onResize">
```

### Debounce
Use debounce when you only need to be notified when resize events ends.

* With default timeout (150 ms):
```javascript
<div v-resize.debounce="onResize">
```

* With custom timeout (in ms):
```javascript
<div v-resize.debounce.50="onResize">
```
